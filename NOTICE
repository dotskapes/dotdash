Historical Note:

dotDash was developed for the dotSkapes Virtual Lab (dVL) with 
support from the Gottesman Fund, UW-Madison Global Health Institute 
and EcoHealth Alliance. The dVL was co-founded by Nico Preston 
and Zack Krejci in 2010. 

The dotDash idea is partially derived from the other components of the dVL 
including SaVaGeLib, map viewing client, dotLab and WiggleMaps. The repo
was originally called dash on Github.

Previous versions of dotDash (<0.5) were licensed under MIT.

Starting with version 0.5, dotDash is distributed under the
